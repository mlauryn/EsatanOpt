*strip of carbo fibre (1mm thick, width = side length, thermal path length 7 mm), 2 W/mK transverse conductivity from Gilmore page 310
**maximum conductance derived from esatan conductive interface as fused together aluminum walls
***1mm thick silicon 0.25 W/mK
****0.25mm thick boron nitride 4 W/mK
In the future should update solar generation according to cell temperature
